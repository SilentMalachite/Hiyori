# Note: Gradle should run on JDK 21 for jlink/jpackage tasks.
# On CI this is handled by actions/setup-java. Locally, ensure JAVA_HOME points to JDK 21
# or run Gradle via a JDK 21 environment (e.g., jenv, SDKMAN).
# If you really need to pin locally, uncomment and set a valid path:
# org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk-21
